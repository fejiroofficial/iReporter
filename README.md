Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.


## Features
1. Users can create an account and log in.
2. Users can create a red-flag record (An incident linked to corruption).
3. Users can create intervention record (a call for a government agency to intervene e.g
repair bad road sections, collapsed bridges, flooding e.t.c).
4. Users can edit their red-flag or intervention records.
5. Users can delete their red-flag or intervention records.
6. Users can add geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention
records .
7. Users can change the geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) attached to their red-flag or
intervention records .
8. Admin can change the status of a record to either under investigation, rejected (in the
event of a false claim) or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and
resolved) .
