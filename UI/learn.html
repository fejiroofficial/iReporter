      <div class="learn-content-header">WHAT IS CORRUPTION</div>
      <div class="learn-content-title">OUR DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION</div>
      <p>Corruption is the abuse of public resources or public power for personal gain. iReporter is concerned with any
        such abuse by anyone at any level of government or in business.</p>
      <h3>Examples of public resources:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Money, goods, vehicles, buildings and any other resources that belong to the government</li>
        <li>Pension funds and medical aid funds</li>
        <li>Trade union money and resources</li>
        <li>Lottery money</li>
        <li>Donations to charities</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common forms of corruption:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A business individual pays a bribe to a government official in order to be given a government contract or license
        </li>
        <li>The use of government-owned resources, such as motor vehicles, for private purposes</li>
        <li>A government official takes advantage of his or her position to favour a family member or business associate for
          a job or tender contract. This is commonly called nepotism</li>
        <li>A police officer solicits a bribe or a member of the public offers one in order to escape lawful punishment</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="learn-content-title">WE ARE ALL AFFECTED</div>
      <h3>Corruption affects us all</h3>
      <p>
        Corruption affects us all. It threatens sustainable economic development, ethical values and justice; it destabilises our
        society and endangers the rule of law. It undermines the institutions and values of our democracy. But because public
        policies and public resources are largely beneficial to poor people, it is they who suffer the harmful effects of
        corruption most grievously.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be dependent on the government for housing, healthcare, education, security and welfare, makes the poor most vulnerable
        to corruption since it stalls service delivery. Delays in infrastructure development, poor building quality and layers
        of additional costs are all consequences of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>Many acts of corruption deprive our citizens of their constitutional and their human rights.</p>
      <h3>Economic implications</h3>
      <p>Corruption and international perceptions of corruption in Africa has been damaging to the continent's reputation
        and has created obstacles to local and foreign direct investment, flows to the stock market, global competitiveness,
        economic growth and has ultimately distorted the development and upliftment of our people.</p>
      <p>Public money is for government services and projects. Taxes collected, bonds issued, income from government investments
        and other means of financing government expenditure are meant for social grants, education, hospitals, roads, the
        supply of power and water and to ensure the personal security of our citizens.</p>

      <p>Corruption and bad management practices eat into the nationâ€™s wealth, channelling money away from such projects and
        the very people most dependent on government for support.</p>
      <p>Countless studies around the world show how corruption can interrupt investment, restrict trade, reduce economic growth
        and distort the facts and figures associated with government expenditure. But the most alarming studies are the ones
        directly linking corruption in certain countries to increasing levels of poverty and income inequality.</p>
      <p>Because corruption creates fiscal distortions and redirects money allocated to income grants, eligibility for housing
        or pensions and weakens service delivery, it is usually the poor who suffer most. Income inequality has increased
        in most countries experiencing high levels of corruption.</p>
      <p>To tackle corruption in Africa, we must all play our part. </p>  
      <P>SAY NO TO CORRUPTION!!!</P>
